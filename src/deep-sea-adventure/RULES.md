# Deep Sea Adventure - Rules

## Objective

The aim of the game is to descend along the path collecting treasures, and return to the submarine before the shared oxygen runs out. Each treasure is worth a different amount of points, and the winner is the player with the most points at the end of the game.

## Rounds

The game is played in three rounds. In each round, there is a shared pool of 25 units of oxygen. As each player collects treasures, they will use up oxygen. When the oxygen levels reach zero, the current player finishes their turn and then each player who hasn't returned to the submarine drops any held treasures to the bottom of the path and returns empty handed. After each round, empty spaces along the path are removed, and dropped treasures are placed in groups of three as a single mega-treasure at the end of the path.

## Game setup

The game can support 2-5 players, and randomly determines which player starts. The players each control a diver in one of the following colours: blue, green, yellow, orange, and purple. All players start in the submarine.

The path starts below the submarine and descends along a winding route. The path consists of treasure tokens in one of four levels:
- Level 1: 8 treasures, 2 each with point values between 0-3. These are triangular in shape with a slight convex curve to the edges, and light blue;
- level 2: 8 treasures, 2 each with point values between 4-7. These are square in shape, and a slightly darker blue;
- level 3: 8 treasures, 2 each with point values between 8-11. These are hexagonal in shape, and a darker blue still;
- level 4: 8 treasures, 2 each with point values between 12-15. These are octagonal in shape, and the darkest blue.

Each treasure token has the point value hidden on the back, and a number of white dots equal to its level on the front.

## Gameplay

Players take it in turns to roll a pair of dice. Each die has 6 sides, with the numbers 1-3 each appearing twice. The player then moves a number of spaces along the path equal to the number rolled on the dice minus the number of treasures they are holding. When they land on a treasure token, they may choose to collect that treasure and hold on to it. When they take a treasure, they replace it with an empty space on the path, denotes by a circular token with a cross through it. They do not reveal the score of the treasure token until the end of the round. At the beginning of each player's turn, they lose oxygen units from the shared supply equal to the number of treasure tokens they are holding. Before rolling, if the player is still moving downwards, they can choose to turn around and head back to the submarine.

If a player ends their turn on an empty space token, they may choose to drop one of their held treasures, replacing the empty space token with that treasure.
